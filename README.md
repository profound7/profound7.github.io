This site is where I'll blog about mostly
programming, tutorials, and sometimes other stuff. This site is built using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Syntax highlighting using
[Prism](http://prismjs.com/), and math formatting using
[KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/). Stylesheets written in
[Scss](http://sass-lang.com/). Comments powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).

I designed this theme using Bootstrap as the base. Like it? It's
[open source][repo]. Fork it, customize it, and use it. But do remember to
change the identifying keys for Disqus and Google Analytics, which is all in
the `_config.yml` file. Spot anything wrong with the theme?
[Create a new issue][issue] and report the bug.
